Wanted to have a visual display for the family to see how long until our next vacation. Leveraged a combination of ChatGPT and online tutorials, especially quite a few from https://randomnerdtutorials.com/ to get this working. I had to modify one of the .h files that I downloaded to allow for the right pin access between all the parts.

Parts: 
* ESP32-DevKitC-32E from Espressif
* Hosyond 2.4 Inches TFT LCD Touch Screen Shield Display Module 320x240 SPI Serial ILI9341 with Touch Pen Compatible with Arduino R3/Mega2560 Development Board
* 2PCS DS3231 AT24C32 IIC RTC Module Clock Timer Memory Module Beats Replace DS1307 I2C RTC Board with Male to Female Jumper Wire Cable
* Breadboard - get everything working first
